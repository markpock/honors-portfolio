It was those charging stations, which continue to dot campus — then the stickers on computers in seemingly every lab from all disparate parts of campus. When I joined the ASUW senate at the beginning of my sophomore year, a vacancy for ASUW liaison to the STFC opened up — so I took it. I spent the rest of that year as a committee member. I gave up future opportunities as a teaching assistant for it — committee meetings had regular time conflicts with course staff meetings, and I opted to choose the former instead of the latter."}),e.jsx("p",{children:"That spring, I stood for election as chair. It was an odd election — nine voters, including myself, and two candidates (again including myself), one of whom (or perhaps both) didn't really want to run. Yes, I agonized over whether it would be a good choice, whether I ought instead to have focused on other pursuits. I decided to run anyway. In retrospect, it wasn't my finest choice.

Then again, the notion that learning must be codified to be real poses itself a variety of problems, so maybe I did learn more than I might imagine. That year, the STF's hands — my hands — were bound by the University of Washington's Financial Transformation, which saw UW migrate from the old financial system it had used to Workday. In order to spend any university money, a budget needs to be created. On the old system, this was as easy as walking down the hall and asking financial personnel to click a button. On the new system, budgets can only be created by the central authority, with whom a ticket needs to be filed, and in whose hands the ability to spend money solely lies. "When can we get worktags?" — this was the constant refrain. As a result, not much money ended up getting spent.`}),e.jsxs("p",{children:["To be sure, I had big hopes going into that position.
